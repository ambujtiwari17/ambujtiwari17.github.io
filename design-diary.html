								<h3 class="cs-topics">Microwave Oven</h3>
								<p class="cs-paras">My first visit to the iSchool kitchen at UT was filled with initial moments of surprise and amazement followed by confusion. And by that, I mean loads of confusion. I could see many drawers and cupboards, each having a specific purpose for keeping plates, cups, bowls, glasses, party supplies etc. Suddenly, I look over to the left to find a microwave sitting on the countertop. With just a quick glance, I noticed something didn’t feel right.</p> 

								<div class="row" style="padding-top:30px;padding-bottom: 30px">
								<div>
								<img class="img-responsive" style="width:50%;margin-left:auto;margin-right: auto;display:block;" src="img/micro.jpg"/>
								</div>
								</div>




								<p class="cs-paras">It just looked and seemed like the “unopenable” microwave! Why? Because there was no handle or button to open it. Oh wait, there was? (that rectangular thing you see there, merged perfectly with the body color, that’s the eject button) That is the button. This is how my trail of thought looked like:</p>

								<blockquote class="blockquote cs-paras" style="font-style: italic">
									A microwave! Wait.. Why does it not have a handle?<br>
									(confused)<br>
									How do I open it though?<br>
									(tries to prop it open by pulling the bottom part)<br>
									Okay, that doesn’t work.<br> 
									(pushes the button once, still doesn’t open)<br>
									Okay, am I doing something wrong?<br>
									(presses the button all the way through, and the microwave door opens)<br>
									Finally! (phew)
								</blockquote>

								<p class="cs-paras">Maybe the problem wasn’t the button. It could have been a logical design choice, but the problem lied in the lack of a clear signifier. According to Norman, a signifier is “any mark or sound, any perceivable indicator that communicates appropriate behavior to a person” (Norman, 2013). Printing a simple or labeling the button with ‘Push’ or “Press’ on top of the button can solve the problem of searching for the right to open the microwave door. This is a discoverability issue that can be solved by placing the proper signifier in the desired location.</p>

								<p class="cs-paras">But, that’s not the only solution. I still feel providing handles to open a microwave door is a much better design choice than having push buttons. Handles provide better affordance to open doors. An affordance as described by Norman is “a relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could possibly be used”. A door affords pushing/pulling and a handle lends that affordance easily.</p>

								<p class="cs-paras"><b>Other possible design recommendations:</b></p>
								<ol class="cs-paras">
									<li>Even after pushing the button, the user has to open the door by herself. For closing, the button is not used at all. It is just being used as an eject button. Instead, these buttons could be used to automate the door movement. On a button press, the door swivels out for opening and swivels in for closing. Although the speed of opening and closing should be controlled here so as to avoid any potential accidents or mishaps.</li> 
									<li>The buttons could be colored differently from the rest of the microwave body, similar to CTA buttons on digital interfaces that make the interaction target clear to the user.</li>
								</ol>

								<h3 class="cs-topics">Ceiling Fan with Lights</h3>
								<p class="cs-paras">When I moved into my new apartment here in the United States in August last year, I had troubles using the fan-lights hybrid system in my room. The system is a combination of ceiling fan and lights all built and integrated into one single body, with the three lights protruding out of the central part and making 120 degree angles with each other. It has two pull cords attached to the center of the piece, one short and the other long. These cords are used to operate the two individual pieces of the system - the short cord is used to operate the lights and the longer cord for operating the fan, including changing and adjusting the fan speeds.</p> 

								<p class="cs-paras">On multiple occasions, I have switched on the light instead of the fan and vice-versa. I have also pulled one of the two cords only to find out later that the power is turned from the main switch itself. And I have spent minutes trying to get the fan run at the right speed by judging the air flow. These are all problems that could have been easily avoided.</p>

								<div class="row" style="padding-top:30px;padding-bottom: 30px">
								<div>
								<img class="img-responsive" style="width:50%;margin-left:auto;margin-right: auto;display:block;" src="img/lights-fan.jpg"/>
								</div>
								</div>

								<p class="cs-paras">As much as I like the elegant design and visual appeal of the system, it has some serious usability problems that make it plain difficult to use. Here are some that I identified with the design:</p>
								<ol class="cs-paras">
									<li>The two pull cords do not clearly state the purpose which they solve. There are no signs that tell which cord is used to operate what.</li>
									<li>Besides the individual pull cords that are used to switch on/off the lights and fan, the fan-lights system has a separate switch to power on/off the whole system. Thus, in essence there are three separate controls - for the lights, the fan and for both. This just adds to the confusion.</li>
									<li>The fan has a total of four states of operation, out of which three are for adjusting speed - high, medium, low and the fourth one is the OFF state. However, there is no way to tell which speed the fan is currently running on and to switch off the fan, the cord has to be pulled x times, where x is the current fan speed (if the fan speeds are say numbered 3, 2, 1 from high to low). This just adds to the cognitive load of the user. In fact, the cognitive load here is double. First, there is no way to figure out the current fan speed, and to add to that there is no way to reach the off state without passing through the intermediate states.</li>
								</ol>


								<p class="cs-paras">For (1), this problem can be solved by using the correct signifiers. A signifier is “any mark or sound, any perceivable indicator that communicates appropriate behavior to a person” (Norman, 2013). Putting labels for ‘lights’ and ‘fan’ on the end of the cords can help the user know which cord operates which of the two things.</p>

								<p class="cs-paras">For (2), there should be separate switches for both light and fans that individually control the two. This eliminates the need of having a third switch and reduces confusion significantly. But the functionalities of switching on/off the fan and regulating the fan speeds can be combined in a single solution in order to further reduce confusion, as discussed in the next paragraph.</p>

								<p class="cs-paras">For (3), this violates Nielsen’s design guidelines of “Visibility of system status” and “Recognition rather than recall” (Nielsen, 1994). In order to address this, there should be simply a regulator mounted on the side wall that has all the speeds clearly marked and numbered from low(1) to high(3) and a ‘0’ for power off. The regulator can be rotated in a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction to control the fan speeds. Having a simple regulator switch for controlling fan speeds is a better solution because:</p>

								<div class="row">
									<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6">
								<ol class="cs-paras">
									<li>Easier to reach the OFF state from any direction (clockwise or anti-clockwise).</li> 
									<li>Communicates the user about the current speed and easier to switch to higher (or lower) speeds with a simple twist of the regulator knob by the hand.</li>
								</ol>

								<h3 class="cs-topics">Folding Auditorium Seats</h3>
								<p class="cs-paras">I have had my fair share of problems with folding seats at auditoriums and theatres. You might wonder what and where is the problem? They can fold and unfold back as and when required.  Some of them can even recline and have cup holders integrated into the design.</p> 

								<div class="row" style="padding-top:30px;padding-bottom: 30px">
								<div>
								<img class="img-responsive" style="width:50%;margin-left:auto;margin-right: auto;display:block;" src="img/fold-seats.jpg"/>
								</div>
								</div>

								<p class="cs-paras">Well, the problem lies in the fact that you can’t lock these into position. Even if you somehow manage to sit on one, every time you rise it springs back up and folds again. You always have to use one hand to keep it pressed down and then sit on it. Imagine if both your hands are busy because you’re holding a tray of food items that you bought during the intermission break and you want to sit without dropping or spilling any food. And also, when you try to adjust yourself in these seats, they keep moving and won’t stay in place. It is annoying, to say the least.</p>

								<p class="cs-paras">These are some everyday situations that require considerations. According to Schneiderman, design should make users feel that they are in control. One of Nielsen’s guidelines also include “user control and freedom” as an important guideline to consider for while designing.</p>

								<p class="cs-paras">While I do agree and acknowledge that folding the seats saves space and have no qualms about that, there still should be a way to keep these seats from folding back and one should be able to lock these into position. This is where my design recommendation comes into place.</p>


								<p class="cs-paras">A simple locking mechanism to lock the seats into their place. When the seats are unfolded all the way down and when the seats are fully open, such that the actual seat is horizontally flat and parallel to the floor, they can be pressed a little further so as to lock the seat into its place. Similarly, when the seats are pressed down again it releases the lock and the seats can then be folded back up. This method ensures that the seats remain in their position and don't fold back unless voluntarily chosen to.</p>

								<h3 class="cs-topics">CapMetro Bus Card Swiping Machines</h3>
								<p class="cs-paras">Capital Metro is Austin's regional public transportation provider. It operates bus, paratransit services and a commuter rail system known as the Capital MetroRail in Austin and several suburbs in Travis and Williamson counties here in Texas.</p> 

								<p class="cs-paras">The CapMetro bus accepts exact change, a screenshot of your ticket on the phone or you may use a pass for a ride on the bus. The pass is a printed ticket that is used to validate the ride. Each bus has a card reader installed at the front of the bus, right next to the driver’s seat. Any rider who is riding on the bus has to swipe their card. As a student, I rely on the CapMetro bus services to commute to and from the college. I also use it to go to other parts of the city such as Downtown, North Austin and Riverside.
								</p>

								<p class="cs-paras">The issue lies with the card swiping machines that these buses are equipped with. When I first rode the bus, I experienced this problem first hand and also observed many users facing the same problem. Even to date I see users struggling with this issue, first time riders or experienced users alike.</p>

								<div class="row" style="padding-top:30px;padding-bottom: 30px">
								<div>
								<img class="img-responsive" style="width:50%;margin-left:auto;margin-right: auto;display:block;" src="img/card-swipe.png"/>
								</div>
								</div>


								<p class="cs-paras">Since the users are required to swipe their cards (or passes) through the machine, they get it wrong most of the time. And because each card has two sides and has to be swiped along the two longer edge, that makes it four possible ways in which one can swipe the card, out of which only one is correct. On top of that, to simplify (or complicate) things, you can swipe either left to right, or right to left. One day, I noticed that the card swiping machine was broken. It was only accepting cards that were swiped towards right and not the other way around. Almost every user that boarded the bus would swipe their card the forward way, which is the most intuitive way and it works every time for them. All of them tried swiping three times only to be corrected by the driver the fourth time to try swiping in reverse. That worked! But it is not the user’s fault to understand how it works, is it?</p>


								<p class="cs-paras">The problem is, the bus service assumes some inherent knowledge in the user about the correct way to swipe the card. It assumes that the user would know which is the right side and right edge to swipe the card along. According to one of Dieter Rams’ ‘10 Commandments for Good Design’, good design makes a product understandable. This means that a good design is self-explanatory.

								</div>
								</div></div>
									<div class="col-sm-7 col-md-7">
								<p class="cs-paras">I believe that this problem can be solved simply by eliminating the need to swipe. A much more intuitive solution is replacing these card swipe machines with contactless NFC card reader machines. The type where you just need to present the card in front of the machine and the machine does the work for you. Google Pay uses contactless terminals at outlets to facilitate transactions. Simple, right?</p></div>

								<h3 class="cs-topics">Thermostat Design</h3>
								<p class="cs-paras">A thermostat is a device that is used to automatically regulate temperature or to activate a device when the temperature reaches a certain point. These are used for example, in central heating systems and refrigerators. The thermostat that I have at my apartment, that is used to control its central heating system and regulate the room temperature has a very complicated interface.</p> 

								<p class="cs-paras">It has an LCD display next to which are two buttons labeled up and down that are used to increase or decrease the temperate. It also has a section below it that is secured with a lid. The lid can be popped open to reveal more buttons and controls. These buttons are labeled as TIME, PRGM, RUN, HOLD AND SYSTEM MODE.  The lid also has instructions plastered on to it to help the user understand the controls. There is also a toggle switch for FAN with two switch modes - ON and AUTO.  Thus, there are a total of seven buttons and a toggle switch as a part of the thermostat interface.</p>

								<div class="row" style="padding-top:30px;padding-bottom: 30px">
								<div>
								<img class="img-responsive" style="width:50%;margin-left:auto;margin-right: auto;display:block;" src="img/thermostat.jpg"/>
								</div>
								</div>

								<p class="cs-paras">According to both Schneiderman (1987) and Nielsen (1990), design should strive for consistency. The consistency of an interactive system strongly affects how quickly its users progress from controlled, consciously monitored, slow operation to automatic, unmonitored, faster operation (Schneider & Shiffrin, 1997)</p>


								<p class="cs-paras">Coming to the problems, these are some major ones that I identified with the design:</p>

								<ol class="cs-paras">
									<li>Some buttons use short forms or abbreviations. The PRGM button is used to program the thermostat. It should be clearly be labeled as PROGRAM.</li> 
									<li>The SYSTEM MODE button is wider and different in shape and form than the other buttons. This reflects inconsistency in design. A different shaped button is not needed since there are labels for each button to convey their intended function. Also, what is the need for having SYSTEM MODE as the label for the button when just the word MODE suffices the purpose?</li>
									<li>The RUN and HOLD buttons: HOLD is used to maintain a constant temperature and RUN is used to cancel this setting. The choice of words is clearly counterintuitive. In the absence of an instruction manual, it makes it unclear as to in what context these should be pressed and increases confusion.</li>
									<li>However, they both are combined and connected with FLTR (short for filter) across them. Does this activate the filter function? How does it do that? Do I have to press both the buttons simultaneously in order to activate it? So much confusion.</li>
									<li>Pressing the SYSTEM MODE changes the mode to HEAT, COOL and a third hybrid, HEAT-COOL mode. But what is this third mode supposed to mean? Maybe this is the AUTO mode that changes temperature automatically?</li>
								</ol>

								<p class="cs-paras">Here are some possible design recommendations that can help improve the interaction experience with the interface:</p>

								<ol class="cs-paras">
									<li>Make all buttons the same size, shape and form, especially when labels are being used to uniquely identify. Consistency is key when it comes to good design.</li> 
									<li>Avoid confusing terms for labels and use appropriate terms that convey the intended function. Use full forms instead of abbreviations wherever possible. </li>
									<li>Have six buttons in total, two for up/down, one each for PROGRAM, TIME and MODE, and then just one button labeled as HOLD. This button, when pressed for long activates the function to maintain a constant temperature and a long press again deactivates it. This way, user knows that they have to hold or keep the button pressed to activate or deactivate a certain function.</li>
								</ol>

								<h3 class="cs-topics">Delhi Metro Mobile App</h3>
								<p class="cs-paras">The Delhi Metro is a rapid transit system serving Delhi and its satellite cities of Bahadurgarh, Ballabhgarh, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Gurgaon and Noida in the National Capital Region of India. It is the largest and busiest metro in India, and the world's 9th longest metro system in length and 16th largest in ridership. In the financial year 2016–17, the Delhi Metro had an average daily ridership of 2.76 million passengers and served 100 crore (1.0 billion) riders in total during the year.</p> 

								<p class="cs-paras">For the metro service, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation(DMRC) launched a complementary mobile application a few years ago to provide more information about the different services offered by the Delhi Metro to its riders. Given the huge numbers of population that this widely used transit system of Delhi serves and how critical it is for users to seek information in minimum time possible, it is important to have a design that’s visually clean, robust and efficient.</p>

								<p class="cs-paras">However, the current application design is cumbersome and it is difficult to find relevant information easily within the application. The visual hierarchy is unclear and the overall design is inconsistent. Although the whole application needs a major design overhaul, for the purpose of this entry I chose the current homepage of the application and how applying Gestalt’s principles can help improve the design.</p>


								<p class="cs-paras">I identified the following problems with the current homepage design:</p>

								<ol class="cs-paras">
									<li>No categorization of related items, poor visual hierarchy.</li> 
									<li>No way for the user to know current balance in their metro card.</li>
									<li>Black borders around the five options in the bottom part of the screen drwa user's attention towards information which is non-relevant to their journey.</li>
									<li>“Other info” tab wider than other tabs in the same category which makes the design very inconsistent.</li>
								</ol>

								<p class="cs-paras">There are five Gestalt’s principles for visual perception. In the scope of this entry, I would focus on the principles of proximity, similarity and continuity. For my redesign, I chose to depict how the use of these three principles can help users understand information more clearly, improve visual perception and enhance the design. I did not add any extra features, just reorganized information already present and made a few design changes. The following changes help improve the design:

								<h3 class="cs-topics">CapMetro Mobile App</h3>
								<p class="cs-paras">For the final entry, I chose the CapMetro mobile application. The CapMetro app is a complementary app for the CapMetro bus services in Austin, TX that offers services such as ‘plan trips’, ‘view schedules’ and ‘next departure’. Often times, the buses are delayed due to traffic congestions or other such reasons and the user has to wait long times at the bus stop. Another problem with the buses is sometimes, they run ahead of their schedules and once the bus missed because of being ahead of its arrival times, the user again has to wait 15-20 minutes for the next bus to arrive.</p> 

								<p class="cs-paras">While the app does tell you when is the next departure from a particular stop, there is no way to let the user know whether the bus is delayed or early. The user sees this screen on his mobile phone and thinks everything is fine and proceeds towards the bus stop at his/her own pace. But when they reach, they are disappointed to find out that either they have to wait extra time either because its delayed or because it arrived earlier than scheduled.</p>

								<p class="cs-paras">This issue is related to the visibility of system status (Nielsen, 1990). It means that the design should be able to effectively convey the system status to its user. We need to give a feedback of the user's action within a reasonable time. It is also related to Norman’s and Schneiderman’s principles of offering informative feedback. A system with good visibility allows the user to easily translate goals into actions.</p>

								<p class="cs-paras">In the same line that displays the time remaining for the next bus to come, show the user the current status of the bus - whether it’s delayed, on time or early. This way, users know the current status of the bus and can plan their departure and journey better without the fear of missing the next bus. Google handles this very effectively with their Maps application.</p>
